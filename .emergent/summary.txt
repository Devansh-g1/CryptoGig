The AI engineer successfully initiated the CryptoGig application, iteratively building core features despite facing numerous challenges, primarily with frontend rendering and authentication. The development trajectory highlights an agile approach, where initial user requirements for a client-freelancer-arbitrator DApp with crypto payments were progressively refined. Key iterations involved setting up blockchain infrastructure (Polygon, USDC, Uniswap, RainbowKit), implementing initial dashboards, and then enhancing the user experience with profiles, role switching, team collaboration, and dynamic UI elements. Significant debugging efforts were required to overcome a persistent black screen frontend error, memory limitations, and authentication failures (MetaMask, Google, GitHub), leading to a strategic decision to simplify components and isolate issues. The engineer meticulously updated backend models, created new endpoints, and revised frontend components, demonstrating adaptability in addressing both technical bugs and evolving product requirements.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a full-stack CryptoGig client-freelancer application featuring an arbitrator. Clients should post jobs, paying in cryptocurrency, which converts to stablecoins (USDC on Polygon using Uniswap) held by the arbitrator. Freelancers can withdraw funds in various cryptocurrencies or stablecoins. The application requires three distinct landing pages/dashboards for clients, freelancers, and arbitrators. Only one designated account can be the arbitrator. Key features include dispute resolution by the arbitrator, who earns a 5% project fee and an additional 3% (total 8%) for dispute resolution. The backend must include a Solidity smart contract for client-arbitrator-freelancer transactions, aiming for minimal gas fees. Authentication should use traditional email/password with wallet linking (RainbowKit). The arbitrator is configured via an admin panel. Later requests included freelancer profiles (portfolio, GitHub), role switching, team collaboration with profit sharing (independent of arbitrator), animated GIFs on the landing page, improved gradients, Gmail/GitHub authentication, removal of watermarks, community/chat channels based on skills with voting for participant removal, and mainnet deployment instructions. The current state also involves fixing issues like black screens and non-functional sign-in.

<current_work>
Currently, the AI engineer is focused on resolving a persistent black screen issue on the frontend, indicating a React rendering problem. After several attempts to fix the  directly, the strategy shifted to isolating the problem.
1.  **Diagnosis:** The engineer created a minimal  and temporarily replaced  with  to render this simple component. This confirmed that React itself was functional, implying the issue lay within the  component or its dependencies.
2.  **Solution Attempt:** A new, simplified landing page, , was created. This new file aims to provide a stable, minimal version of the landing page, stripped of complex elements that might be causing the black screen error.
3.  **Next Immediate Step:** The trajectory ends with the intent to update  to use this new  to confirm a stable landing page rendering.
The backend authentication for Google and GitHub was implemented, but the user reported blocked authentication errors. Email verification with magic links has also been implemented in the backend.
